## Introduction

In this session, I'll talk about the MSB Plan for R2 and Beyond. I'll also discuss the OMSA(ONAP Microservice Architecture): the vision of ONAP Microservice Architecture to support Carrier-Grade requirements of ONAP Microservices, which includes Service Orchestration, Service Discovery, Inter-service Communication, Service Governance and Service Monitoring and External API Gateway.

ONAP Architecture Principle:  ONAP modules should be designed as microservices: service-based with clear, concise function addressed by each service with loose coupling.

MSB Plan for R2 and Beyond:
* Stability and Reliability: Reliable communication with retries and circuit breaker
* Security: Secured communication with TLS
* Performance: Latency aware load balancing with warm cache
* Observability: Metrics measurement and distributed tracing without instrumentingapplication
* Manageability: Routing rule and rate limiting enforcement
* Testability: Fault injection to test resilienceof ONAP

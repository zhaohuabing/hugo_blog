During this community meeting, we introduced Aeraki Mesh’s newly released Access Log and Service Metrics features. We also invited experts from Boss Zhipin and Shopline to share hands-on examples of Dubbo based on Aeraki Mesh. Furthermore, we introduced the new features of multiplexing and Gateway support for the MetaProtocol application protocol, which are being contributed by the Tencent Games project and Boss Zhipin.

The Access Log and Service Metrics functionalities will help users better understand their network performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize their applications. We’re excited to see how these new features will improve our users' experiences with Aeraki Mesh.

During the meeting, the experts from Boss Zhipin and Shopline demonstrated how Dubbo, a popular open-source RPC framework, can be used with Aeraki Mesh. Their presentations provided valuable insights and hands-on examples for users who are interested in using Dubbo with Aeraki Mesh.

We are also thrilled to announce the addition of multiplexing for the Aeraki Mesh data plane - MetaProtocol Proxy and Gateway support for non-HTTP protocols. These features will enhance the functionality of the Tencent Games project and Boss Zhipin, and we believe that our users will benefit greatly from their contributions.

Thank you to everyone who attended the community meeting. We look forward to continuing to improve Aeraki Mesh and providing our users with the best possible experience.

## Introduction

In this session, I'll talk about the MSB(Microservice BUS) project we have been using in OPEN-O as the fabric for Microservice communications.

First, I will start with why we choose Microservice Architecture in OPEN-O.

Then, I’d like to talk about the challenges we were facing when we turn to the microservice approach.

Finally, How we address these challenges in OPEN-O with the help of Microservice BUS
And what’s the potential benefit MSB could bring to ONAP.

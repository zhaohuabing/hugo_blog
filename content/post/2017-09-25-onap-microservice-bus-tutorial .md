## Introduction

Microservices Bus(MSB) provide a reliable, resilient and scalable communication and governance infrastructure to support Microservice Architecture including including service registration/discovery, external API gateway, internal API gateway, client SDK. It's a pluggable architecture so it can integrate with auth service provider to provide centralized Authentication & Authorization. MSB also provides a service portal to manage the REST APIs.

MSB doesn’t depend on a specific environment. It can work in bare metal, virtual machine or containerized environment.

How MSB fits in ONAP architecture?

In this demo, Iâ€™ll walk you through how to use Envoy Gatewayâ€™s SecurityPolicy to enforce OIDC authentication and authorization, using Amazon Cognito as the identity provider.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

- Set up Envoy Gateway in your Kubernetes cluster
- Configure a Gateway + HTTPRoute for HTTPS traffic
- Attach a SecurityPolicy to protect backend services
- Validate JWT tokens and apply fine-grained access control

ðŸŽ¯ Everything is handled at the gateway layer â€” your backend stays clean and simple.

##  "My Labor Day Holiday"

## Opening
Hey! Today I’d like to tell you about how I spent my Labor Day holiday, and maybe we can chat about how you usually spend yours. I’m curious to hear what you usually do on holidays or long weekends!

## Main Content

We spent the first two days of the holiday at home. On the first day, my wife and I went to a local market to buy some fresh vegetables and fruits. The market is quite well-known in nearby neighborhoods.

Compared to supermarkets, you can find more local ingredients at the market — they’re usually cheaper and fresher, too.

The market is not far, We took the bus — it was just four stops from our home.

It’s lively and full of energy,  the air filled with the smell of fresh produce, spices, and street snacks. You can find everything there, from seasonal fruits and vegetables to fresh meat, tofu, and handmade noodles.

Discussion Questions
* Do you like visiting local markets? What do you usually buy there?

For lunch, I cooked Chinese-style braised beef with bamboo shoots. In the evening, we drove to a nearby shopping mall. Sunny and Linda enjoy hanging out there because there are many clothing stores. Linda bought a new baseball cap, and I picked up a few new pairs of socks.

On the second day, we all stayed at home. Linda worked on her homework while Sunny and I cleaned the house.

On the third day, Linda went back to school. Sunny and I drove to a Taoist temple with two friends. This temple is famous for Wenchang Dijun, the god of study. Many students visit to pray for good grades. We went there to pray for Linda, wishing her success on the Gaokao and hoping she gets into a good university.

I learned the Taoist greeting gesture in the temple.
You make a fist with your right hand and cover it with your left palm, then hold it in front of your chest. It’s a traditional way to show respect at Taoist temples.

Afterward, we went to a nearby hiking trail. This trail is part of the ancient Su Road, which used to connect the Chengdu Plain and Guanzhong Plain in ancient times. The trail dates back to the Qin Dynasty. To provide shade for the passengers, many trees have been planted along the trail — the oldest one is around 2,300 years old. We hiked for about two hours and then drove home.
